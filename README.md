# FYP-CMS
Final Year Project A - Web-based IoT Crop Management System for monitoring plantation conditions with sensors (air temperature and humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity). This system will utilize Arduino as our component for the IoT system to read the data from the sensors and send it online to our database, while our front-end web application will use Bootstrap and AngularJS and graphing/chart frameworks to display the data. That's the summary!
